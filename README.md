# Metrocar Funnel Analysis

## Introduction

Metrocar is a ride-sharing platform that connects riders and drivers through its mobile application. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, key metrics, business questions, and the analysis and recommendations derived from the data.

## Objective

- **Optimize funnel performance:** Enhance user satisfaction and strengthen market position through detailed analysis and actionable recommendations for improved user engagement and revenue growth.

## Key Metrics

- Download-to-signup conversion rates
- Ride request acceptance rates
- Completed ride rates
- Payment processing efficiency
- User review submissions

## Business Questions

1. What steps of the funnel should we research and improve? Are there any specific drop-off points preventing users from completing their first ride?
2. Where should we focus our marketing budget among different platforms (iOS, Android, Web) for the upcoming year?
3. What age groups perform best at each stage of our funnel? Which age group(s) likely contain our target customers?
4. If we want to adopt a price-surging strategy, what does the distribution of ride requests look like throughout the day?
5. What part of our funnel has the lowest conversion rate, and how can we improve it?
